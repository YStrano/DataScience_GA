## Ideas for Class Activities

#### One and Done

Each student can share the project idea that they are attached to in front of the class. To keep the class moving, it'd be a better idea to load all presentations onto _one_ computer or deck. Each student gets 60 seconds to talk through their idea, and then another 60 seconds for their classmates to submit feedback (via Google Form, markdown files, etc).

#### Small Group Share

Group students into small groups of 4-6. In each group, students walk through up to 2 different ideas that they have prepped, and get feedback from their peers. Each group submits their shared feedback. An extension would be to allow each group to pick one project/person to share in front of the whole class.
