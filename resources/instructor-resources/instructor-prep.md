## Pre-Course Responsibilities

We highly recommend you begin preparing your lessons at least 2-4 weeks before the course starts. A good benchmark is to prepare the first 5 - 6 lessons before the course actually begins.

During these preparation weeks you should:

- Review the high-level unit structure, lesson plans, project arcs, and instructor resources provided.
- Review the objectives as well as sample, starter, and solution code for each lesson, lab, and project.
- Read through our [student feedback guide](../../projects/project-feedback.md) and review the rubrics for each project.
- Decide how you want to incorporate your experiences into lesson materials and deliverables.
- Create / update slide decks to correspond with the materials you plan to teach.
  - We recommend using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#full-setup) to automatically generate slides from external markdown files.
- Review these [required student onboarding tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xoC18JHk880C9n_cAPCsGn-sNqexPgTIIkmUd7cTJQw/edit?usp=sharing), and ask your producer for access to the [pre-course onboarding assessment](https://mobilega.typeform.com/to/DqgDfO), which will help you gauge your students' comfort level with introductory concepts.
- Review our [course technical requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hQZSmYfQwsOrc7Po4s7p1oDSKX8BAgKdgAKE4IRzh7g/edit?usp=sharing).

> Note: We recommend that you follow the lesson structure provided as a baseline, but feel free to add or supplement the curriculum with materials based on your experience and students' comfort level. If you'd like to suggest future curriculum revisions, please see [our contributing guidelines](../../contributing.md).

## Pre-Work Objectives

When preparing your slide decks and reviewing the curriculum, keep in mind the following pre-work criteria for students:

#### Task Objectives
*Before the first class, students should have already:*

- Installed Python (2.7)
- Installed Anaconda
- Created a github account

#### Learning Objectives
*Before the first class, students should be able to:*

- Define basic data types used in object-oriented programming
- Recall the Python syntax for lists, dictionaries, and functions
- Create files and navigate directories using the command line interface (for their specific environment)

#### Preliminary Goals:
*After the first week, students will be able to:*

1. Utilize unix commands to navigate the file system and modify files
  - Summarize a basic filesystem structure, including absolute and relative paths
  - Use the most common commands to navigate and modify files / directories via the Terminal window.

2. Write programs that utilize the different data types
  - Describe the concept of a "data type" and how it relates to variables
  - Identify and define variable with the following data types: int, float, string, boolean, list, and dictionary
  - Write code that uses conditional statements to control the flow of a program
  - Declare, assign to, and manipulate data stored in a variable
  - Iterate over and and manipulate values in an array

3. Write functions that accepts a parameter and solves a problem
  - Describe how parameters and arguments relate to functions
  - Create and call a function that accepts parameters to solve a problem
  - Return a value from a function using the return keyword
  - Define and call functions 

4. Write for loops that iterate over arrays and loops
  - Create arrays and manipulate values in Arrays.
  - Describe why arrays are useful and how to use them effectively in Python
  - Write a “for” loop
  - Describe the difference between for and while statements 

> Note that students may need to be reminded to complete the pre-work on the first day of class. We've provided modular lesson components [during your first flex lesson](../../lessons/lesson-05/README.md) that you can use to review this material.
