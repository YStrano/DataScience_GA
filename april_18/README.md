*this is a change*
Welcome to GA's Part-Time Data Science Course (v 2.1)! We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems. 

In this 10 week part-time course, students will use Python to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. Specifically, students will:

- Learn the language of data scientists to contribute as a part of a greater team.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools, python, and the command line.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to a non-technical audience through visual storytelling.


## Data Science Curriculum Repo

Included in this Repository:

1. [**Lessons**](./lessons/) - lesson plans and corresponding assets, including starter & solution code, datasets, & slide decks.
2. [**Projects**](./projects/) - instructions and materials for both UNIT and FINAL projects, including starter code, rubrics, and datasets.
3. [**Resources**](./resources/) - various supplementary instructor and student facing resources, including syllabus & prework.
4. [**Templates**](./templates/) - GA campus educational styleguides with templates and examples for lessons and projects.


## To Get Started

#### â‘ƒ Forking and Collaborating

The structure of this repository provides a way for us to organize our information and use the same vocabulary.

Some cities maintain forks of this repository for collaboration by their local instructors. However, we also encourage the teaching team for each cohort to fork this repository directly, and use it to store your new and improved resources. By the end of the course, we hope you'll have some things to submit to make our curriculum better.

If you have any questions about the organization of resources, or about the scope of the DS curriculum, feel free to open an issue. Please check out our [contributing guidelines](contributing.md) for more details.
