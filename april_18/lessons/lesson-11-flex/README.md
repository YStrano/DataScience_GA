DS | Lesson 11

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Understand unsupervised versus supervised learning
- Apply k-Means and DBSCAN clustering
- Combine clustering with classification and regression


### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*

- Use sckit-learn to fit models
- Use seaborn to create plots
- Use pandas to load datasets


> Instructors: This is a flex lesson and an example lesson on clustering that
you are free to use. You will be switching back and forth between the slides
and the notebooks. Approximate timing:
- One hour for k-Means and exercises
- One hour for DBSCAN and exercises
- One hour on building models after clustering and silhouette metric
