> This lesson purposefully uses a large number of datasets. This allows students to practice opening different types of data files. So, it would be useful to emphasize manually looking at the files to identify the separator and header. Having many datasets available allows us to explore a variety of themes throughout the lesson that might not be present in one dataset alone.

*Note: Datasets have 3 types. ".csv" files are separated by commas, ".tsv" by tabs, and ".tbl" by "|" character*

## Learning Objectives

- **Explain** the definition and purpose of Pandas in a data science context
- **Manipulate** Pandas DataFrames and Series
- **Filter and sort** Pandas data
- **Manipulate** DataFrame columns
- **Define** how to handle null and missing values

---

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:

- Recall and define basic syntax for Python code

---


## Lesson Outline

> Instructor Note: Start with the lesson Jupyter slide deck. Next, walk the students through the lab. Periodically stop and let the students try the challenges. The challenges are typically just 1-3 lines of code that are very similar to what was just discussed.
