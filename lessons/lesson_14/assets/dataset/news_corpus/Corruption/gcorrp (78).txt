Ex-cop in Pacific Grove sentenced to jail on federal charges

A former commander with the Pacific Grove Police Department was sentenced to more than two years in jail and ordered to pay more than $15,000 after pleading guilty to federal charges of extortion and fraud for abusing his authority as a cop and illegally possessing stolen guns, officials said Tuesday.Cmdr. John Nyunt, who retired from the force last year as the investigation into him began, agreed to the sentence in a pair of plea agreements brokered last year, said U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag.In May, Nyunt admitted that a woman approached him to report she had been the victim of electronic surveillance and stalking. Instead of investigating her allegations, Nyunt told the woman she had to hire a private investigator of his choosing.

 She would end up paying roughly $10,000 to Nyunt and the investigator, which was supposed to include security services that were never provided.In December, Nyunt told officials that, aside from working as a police commander, he was a police academy instructor at Monterey Peninsula College. While there, he arranged a deal whereby the school would donate firearms to the Pacific Grove Police Department, with Nyunt accepting them on the department's behalf.Prosecutors said, however, that Nyunt was neither authorized to make such a deal nor to accept the guns - which included semi-automatic pistols, rifles and shotguns.Over the course of about three years, Nyunt sold most of the guns, prosecutors said.Last April, Nyunt pleaded guilty to state charges of dissuading a person from reporting a crime, being an accessory after the fact to theft and burglary, and being an accomplice to the burglary of a business. He received a sentence of three years in prison for those charges, prosecutors said.For his more recent transgressions, Nyunt pleaded guilty to extortion, wire fraud and possession of stolen firearmsU.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman sentenced Nyunt to 30 months in prison, which will run concurrently with his state sentence, and to pay a fine of $5,000 as well as roughly $10,000 in restitution, prosecutors said.
