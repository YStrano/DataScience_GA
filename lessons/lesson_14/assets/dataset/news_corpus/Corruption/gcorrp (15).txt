Angry senator vows to fight corruption charges

A defiant New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez declared that he's "not going anywhere" after he was charged with accepting nearly $1 million in gifts and campaign contributions from a longtime friend in exchange for a stream of political favors.

The Democratic Cuban-American politician was due to appear in a federal court in Newark, New Jersey, on Thursday, in response to charges that he used the power of his Senate seat to benefit Dr Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida eye doctor who prosecutors say provided Menendez with luxury vacations, airline travel, golf trips and tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to a legal-defense fund.

Menendez stayed at Melgen's Spanish-style villa at the luxury Casa de Campo resort, in La Romana province, on the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic, with or without the eye doctor, "on numerous occasions" from August 2006 to January 2013, according to the 14-count indictment.

The indictment will almost certainly lead to a drawn-out legal fight between Menendez and a team of US Justice Department prosecutors who have spent years investigating his ties to Melgen.

Prosecutors will have to prove that a close and longtime friendship between the men was used for criminal purposes, which is likely to revive the legal debate about the constitutional protections afforded to members of Congress for acts they take in office, which Menendez has already signaled as a possible line of defense.

The criminal charges cloud the political future of the top Democrat and former chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has played a leading role on Capitol Hill on matters involving Iran's nuclear program and US efforts to improve ties with Cuba.
