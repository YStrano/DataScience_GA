China reels as former security chief charged with corruption

Prosecutors have charged Zhou Yongkang, China's powerful former security chief, with bribery, abuse of power and leaking state secrets, formalising the case against one of China's most influential politicians and the most high-profile scalp of President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption campaign.

The charges pave the way for a trial likely to grab worldwide attention, with the 72-year-old the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal in Communist Party history.

China's official Xinhua news agency said on Friday that Mr Zhou, who was arrested and expelled from the party last year, took advantage of his seniority to seek benefits for others, accepted "huge" bribes and "intentionally disclosed state secrets".

Xinhua said the alleged misdeeds took place throughout much of his senior career, including his time as a top executive at state-run petroleum giant China National Petroleum Corporation, as the party secretary of China's south-western Sichuan province, and as a member of the party's elite decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee.

No trial date was given was for Mr Zhou's case, which was transferred to a court to the northern city of Tianjin, about a two-hour drive from Beijing.

President Xi's war on graft has reached deep into the most senior levels of central and provincial governments, its state-owned enterprises and fast-growing military, with Mr Xi seen as trying to rid the party of its self-interested warring factions while restoring its credibility in the hearts and minds of the Chinese masses.

The consolidation of power is also seen as a key tactic for Mr Xi to push urgent economic reforms past stubborn vested interests, in a bid to buttress China's slowing and dangerously imbalanced economy.

In recent months, the Communist Party - in a marked departure from its usual projections of a unified front - has overtly targeted and denounced the formation of "cliques" of officials with aligned political and economic interests, naming Mr Zhou and Ling Jihua - a former aide to former president Hu Jintao - among senior officials who have played factional politics against the greater interests of the state. It has also steadily ramped up the profile of its hunt for corrupt officials who have fled overseas.
