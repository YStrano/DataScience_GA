Fed member warns against raising rates too early; Inflation target

US inflationary pressures are unlikely to rise enough to justify lifting interest rates in June, according to a key member of the US Federal Reserve, adding to hopes that the central bank will defer its first rate rise in nearly a decade until at least autumn.

Charles Evans, a voting member of the Federal Reserve's policy committee and one of its most cautious members, warned that there were considerable risks in raising rates too early in an environment where core inflation is persistently below 2 per cent.

"Some say we are behind the curve, that interest rates are unusually low, but we're not at a point of business as usual," Mr Evans said.

Unlike fellow committee member James Bullard , Mr Evans did not worry about the danger of loose monetary policy blowing financial bubbles. Mr Evans' case for sustaining near-zero interest rates until probably spring 2016 rests on his view that there is little inflationary pressure in the US, despite unemployment falling rapidly to 5.5 per cent .

"It is hard to say policy is extremely accommodative when you are undershooting your inflation target . . . We would do well not to be in a hurry to raise rates," Mr Evans said.

He said he would need to see signs that underlying inflation was picking up before wanting to lift rates from their floor. This, he expects, will become clear in early 2016, although he still does not expect inflation to rise back to the Fed's 2 per cent target until 2018.

Speaking in London, the president of the Chicago Fed said the US central bank's credibility was on the line if it failed to show underlying inflation could rise to the target level. "I believe that if we top out below 2 per cent . . . why should anyone have a strong belief that [2 per cent] is a symmetric target when it appears to be a ceiling?"
