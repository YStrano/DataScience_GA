Asian bourses shrug off dull US session

Thursday 03:15 BST. Asia-Pacific markets were upbeat, shrugging off a lacklustre session on Wall Street.

Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.6 per cent after a closely-watched private inflation report indicated that there was plenty of room for the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates further.

Consumer prices rose 1.5 per cent in March year-on-year, compared with 1.3 per cent in February, according to a monthly survey by TD Securities and the Melbourne Institute - below the central bank's 2-3 per cent target band. Official data for Australian inflation are published quarterly.

However, Annette Beacher, chief Asia-Pacific macro strategist at TD Securities, said rising house prices would probably put the brakes on easing.

"While low inflation certainly allows the RBA to cut the cash rate further, we pencil in only one more cash rate reduction to 2 per cent in May, with risks of delay into the second half of the year, should the housing sector keep expanding at an uncomfortable pace," she said.

Elsewhere in the region, the Shanghai Composite was up 0.2 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5 per cent. Country Garden was up as much as 5.8 per cent in Hong Kong after Ping An Insurance agreed to take a 9.9 per cent stake in the Chinese property developer.

In Japan, the Nikkei climbed 1.4 per cent. However Olympus fell 5.2 per cent after Sony sold part of its stake in the camera and endoscope maker. The Japanese electronics group said it expected to make a gain of about Y46.8bn from the sale of the stake, which it bought in 2012.

Overnight, the Wall Street session ended on a downbeat note following disappointing US jobs and manufacturing data. Figures from private payrolls processor ADP showed that 189,000 jobs were created in March, short of the 225,000 expected by analysts.

The US Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index fell to a 22-month low of 51.5 in March, a fifth straight decline.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,059, leaving it 2.7 per cent shy of a record close hit a month ago.

The price of gold was flat at $1,204.17 per ounce. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, was down 1 per cent to $56.51 per barrel.
