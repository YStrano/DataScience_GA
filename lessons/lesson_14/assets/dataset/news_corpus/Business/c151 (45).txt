Q2 forex gains, tug sale lift EMAS profit

Singapore

OFFSHORE support services provider EMAS Offshore said on Tuesday that it plans to trim costs and redouble its efforts to get more of its fleet chartered out, after posting a poorer performance in its shallow-water chartering business for some vessels in its second quarter.

Even though net profit soared 143 per cent to US$9.7 million for the three months to Feb 28, that jump over the previous year came mostly from foreign exchange gains and from selling off one of its anchor handling tugs. Revenue for the quarter slid 10 per cent to US$60.9 million.

EMAS Offshore said that the drop in turnover was mainly because of a weakness in two segments: its shallow-water anchor handling, towing and supply vessels and its shallow-water platform support vessels (PSVs). Fewer anchor handling tugs and small PSVs got chartered out, which weighed down the overall utilisation rate to 79 per cent out of its fleet of 46 offshore support vessels for the six months to Feb 28, it .

The company was formed after offshore and marine firm Ezra Holdings injected its offshore support services division, EMAS Marine, into Ezra's Norwegian associate company EOC Limited as part of a restructuring. The enlarged EOC was renamed EMAS Offshore.

EMAS Offshore chief executive Jon Dunstan said that the combination of the two businesses has helped the enlarged entity to reduce costs and boost operational efficiencies. The group said that it would do more "cost-optimisation" and place an "increased focus on vessel utilisation" to alleviate its gloomier business prospects due to the ongoing oil slump.

Earnings per share rose to 0.02 US cent in the quarter, from 0.01 US cent the preceding year.

EMAS Offshore, which is primarily listed on the Oslo bourse, began trading as a secondary listing on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) mainboard in October 2014.

The counter rose 1.5 cents to S$0.39 on Tuesday.
