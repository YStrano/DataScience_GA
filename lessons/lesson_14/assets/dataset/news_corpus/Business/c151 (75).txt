Mercedes-Benz Sales Race Ahead; First-quarter sales rose nearly 15%, adding to pressure on two rivals

BERLIN—Mercedes-Benz sold nearly 15% more cars during the first quarter compared with the same period last year, setting the bar high for competitors Audi and BMW in the race for the top premium brand, amid strong demand for its C-Class sedans, sport-utility vehicles and luxury compact cars.

The German luxury-car maker owned by Daimler AG, said Wednesday that it sold 429,602 cars in the quarter. Mercedes-Benz's sales growth accelerated in March when it sold nearly 16% more vehicles than in the same month last year.

“Mercedes-Benz recorded the strongest sales month and the best first quarter in the company's history in March," said Ola Källenius, the Mercedes board member in charge of Mercedes-Benz Cars marketing and sales, in a written statement.

Germany's big three premium-car makers are locked in a tight race for the No. 1 spot. Volkswagen AG's Audi unit is threatening to overtake industry leader BMW AG, but Mercedes-Benz has been growing fasterthan its competitors, threatening to move up from the No. 3 position.

Mercedes-Benz is in the middle of a product offensive—including the launch of a new vehicle, the CLA Shooting Brake, on March 28—as it aims to take the top spot by 2020.

The strong showing by Mercedes-Benz was driven by robust growth in Europe, where sales increased 16% to 187,284 cars in the first quarter, and China, where sales advanced nearly 17% to 78,183 cars.

Mercedes-Benz sales in the U.S. rose 9.2% to 29,921 cars in March and increased 7.6% to 78,156 cars in the first quarter.

Sales of Daimler's boutique Smart small-car brand rose 25% to 11,984 cars in March and increased 23% to 28,744 cars in the first quarter.

BMW and Audi are scheduled to report March sales figures in the coming days.
