JPMorgan Says This Stock Could Gain 33%

SK C&C (034730.KS)								By JPMorgan

We initiate on SK C&C (034730.KS) with an Overweight rating and a Dec-15 price target of KRW320,000. The company has a healthy growth profile (boosted by memory module) and stable operating profit margins (high earnings visibility at Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)). A possible merger with SK Holdings (SKH) could be a net positive assuming the company demonstrates clear long-term strategic direction. We also identify rising dividend and potential share buyback given robust free cash flow as positive catalysts.

Strong top-line growth profile and stable OPM trend. We forecast SK C&C to deliver 16%/17% Sales/operating profit compound annual growth rate from 2014-2017E on its steadily improving ITS operation and robust growth in memory modules (90% CAGR until 2017). We identify stable chip supply from SK hynix and strategic alliance with Hon Hai as key drivers. On the ITS side, progress at SK Group's manufacturing affiliates would likely be the key driver for sales expansion.

Possible merger with SKH. We view a possible merger (has been covered by multiple media; Maeil/Korea Economic) as potentially positive to shareholders as we expect the company to maintain a shareholder friendly policy (increasing dividend payout from larger profit pool including brand royalty revenue and probable treasury shares cancelation). We would also look favorably on a merger if the Co demonstrates a clear direction to expand operational value.

Higher dividend and buyback could support valuation. Thanks to its strong operations and SKH-related equity method gain recovery, we forecast ~70% net profit compound annual growth rate over the next three years and expect free cash flow to double throughout our forecasting period (from 2014-2017). We believe a large amount of free cash flow would be used to increase dividends (dividend per share will grow from KRW2,000 in 2014 to KRW5,000 in 2017; 29% payout ratio) and potentially buy back shares (W200bn on average over last three cycles from 2010-2014).

33% upside potential to Dec-15 price target. Our Dec-15 PT of W320,000 is based on 30x FY16E P/E (~33% upside potential). We find – 1) expectation toward operational value expansion; 2) rising shareholder return (dividend and share buyback); and 3) ‘management premium' – justifying valuation multiple compared to historical trading range of (25x-30x forward 12 month P/E). Key downside risks are: 1) lower IT budget spending at affiliates; 2) lower gain from SKH; and 3) extensive memory price drop in the module market
