Eurozone Retail Sales Fall After Four Straight Monthly Rises; Decline in sales comes amid signs that the eurozone’s brush with deflation may be nearing its end

Retail sales in the eurozone fell in February after four successive monthly increases, an indication that the boost to the spending power of households from lower oil prices may be waning.

The European Union's statistics agency Wednesday said retail sales fell 0.2% from January, but were nevertheless 3.0% higher than in the same month of 2014 after strong rises since September.

The sharp decline in energy prices in the final months of last year left households with more money to spend on other goods and services, boosting consumer confidence and spending. But as oil prices have steadied in recent months, that boost has attenuated. For the first time since September, gasoline sales fell, while sales of food and drinks also declined.

With unemployment falling and wages starting to pick up in some parts of the currency area, consumer spending is expected to rise during 2015. But the February dip, even if it proves short-lived, is a reminder that other sources of growth will be needed to keep the eurozone's modest recovery on course.

The decline in sales comes amid signs that the eurozone's brush with deflation may be nearing its end, as consumer prices fell just 0.1% in the 12 months through March, having been down 0.3% in March alone.

Weak consumer demand will make it more difficult for businesses to raise their prices, and the European Central Bank doesn't expect the inflation rate to return to its target of just under 2% until 2017.

In January, the ECB announced a program of bond purchases using freshly created money that is likely to total more than €1 trillion ($1.08 trillion) by September 2016.
