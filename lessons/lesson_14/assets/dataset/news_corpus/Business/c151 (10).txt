Missguided hits high street as sales rise 70pc

THE up-and-coming online fashion retailer Missguided is to sell its clothing in high street stores for the first time through a tie-up with US department store chain Nordstrom.

Missguided was founded in 2009 and has emerged as a rival to Asos and Boohoo. It was founded by entrepreneur Nitin Passi, who created the online retailer from his bedroom. In the year to the end of March, sales grew 70pc to £86m with pre-tax profits growing from £900,000 to £5.5m.

The sales growth is below Mr Passi's ambitious target of hitting £100m of revenues by 2015, but the youth fashion brand is still growing rapidly, thanks in part to a tie-up with the former Pussycat Doll singer Nicole Scherzinger, who designed a range of clothing with Missguided.

The Manchester-based retailer, which has more than 3m registered users, has expanded into the US, Australia and France and will offer its own-brand clothing in Nordstrom stores in the US through a partnership with the chain.

Mr Passi said: "We are thrilled yet again to be celebrating record revenue for the year end. Our huge growth over the past six years indicates that our strategy, rooted in speed, agility and value for consumers, is working.

"Our strategy to date has proven a huge success and we will look to continue to implement and evolve this going forward. We have been able to expand the brand appeal this year through new product collections, and we want to continue to innovate and offer more choice for consumers."

Mr Passi still owns all of Missguided, which has no debts, and has ruled out the prospect of following Asos and Boohoo by floating.
