Toy giant plays with $450m Australian loss

Retail

Toys "R" Us, the self-described "world's first toy supermarket", has racked up accumulated losses of almost $450 million since arriving in Australia. The US-based toy and baby products retailer has operated here for more than two decades. It has more than 30 stores, 11 Babies "R" Us Superstores, online operations and about 1600 employees.

Researchers IBISWorld said it had lost market power over the past five years, but was the second-biggest player in the $850 million toy and game retailing industry. The accounts for Toys "R" Us Australia Pty Ltd show a loss of $15 million for the year to February 1, 2014, an improvement on the previous year's loss of $21.8 million. Annual revenue edged up to $242 million, from $239 million. The company cut advertising in 2014, to $6 million, from $8.2 million. The accounts do not disclose information on management fees to the parent, royalties to other related entities and interest expense to the ultimate parent. They also do not provide commentary on the company's performance or likely developments. But they show Toys "R" Us' parent has accumulated losses for Toys "R" Us Australia of $441 million, and no dividend was paid or proposed. It is unclear whether the company has ever made a profit here. Toys "R" Us was contacted for comment in Sydney.

IBISWorld said the company's arrival in 1993 "placed significant downward pressure on the prices of toys and games". It said the industry now had medium levels of concentration, with Toyworld's owner, Associated Retailers Limited having 27.1 per cent market share, then Toys "R" Us (20.7 per cent), ABC (3.3 per cent) and Games World (less than 1 per cent).

IBISWorld tipped annual growth for the industry of just 1.6 per cent over the next five years.
