Biomet Sales Fall on Currency Headwinds; Orthopedic device manufacturer swings to profit

Biomet Inc. said revenue fell 2.5% in its February quarter due to a stronger dollar, which lead to sales declines in nearly all its geographic regions and product segments.

The Warsaw, Ind., manufacturer of artificial knees and hips, among other orthopedic devices, agreed last year to be acquired by rival Zimmer Holdings Inc. for about $13.35 billion in cash and stock, a bid to position the combined company as a leader in making products to repair muscles and bones.

In October, European Union regulators opened an in-depth probe into the deal, saying it could result in less innovation and higher prices. In late March, the EU ultimately approved the merger after Zimmer agreed to sell three businesses in Europe to assuage antitrust concerns.

For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Biomet swung to a profit of $48.8 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $65.9 million. Adjusted earnings totaled $117.8 million, up from $107.3 million, a year earlier.

Excluding special items, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to $298 million from $272 million a year earlier.

Total sales fell 2.6% to $800.9 million, mostly because of the negative effects of the strong dollar. Sales increased 1.4% on a constant-currency basis.

Sales fell in all Biomet's segments with the exception of a 1.2% increase in the area of spine and bone healing, which also was the segment least affected by currency fluctuations. In comparison, sales in Biomet's biologics segment fell 6.7% but were hurt by a 6.3% currency impact.

Sales in the U.S. rose 1.1% to $514.8 million, while sales in Europe fell 12.3%. Sales in Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific declined 2.5%.

Research and development costs as well as selling and administrative costs both fell about 7%.
