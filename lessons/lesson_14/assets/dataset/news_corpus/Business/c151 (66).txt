Dave & Buster’s Posts Better-Than-Expected Results; Arcade and restaurant chain gives strong full-year guidance

Dave & Buster's Entertainment Inc. said its profit grew more than expected in the February quarter as sales increased in both of its segments, while the company issued guidance for the year that topped expectations.

The Dallas-based arcade and restaurant chain, which went public in October after buyout talks broke down, was founded in 1982 by friends David “Dave" Corriveau and James “Buster" Corley. Dave & Buster's now operates 72 locations across the U.S. and Canada and said it intends to open seven to eight stores this year.

For the year that ends in January 2016, Dave & Buster's expects net income of $36.7 million to $40.4 million and revenue of $808 million to $822 million. Dave & Buster's predicts 3% to 4% growth in same-store sales, a closely watched metric that looks at sales across stores open for at least a year.

Analysts, according to Thomson Reuters, are looking for net income of $30.6 million and revenue of $741.1 million.

Meanwhile, for the quarter ended Feb. 1, the company reported a profit of $14.7 million, or 34 cents a share, up from $4.9 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Dave & Buster's booked 33 cents in per-share profit, up from 18 cents a year ago.

Revenue rose 21% to $207.1 million.

Analysts, according to Thomson Reuters, anticipated 28 cents in per-share profit on $201.4 million in revenue.

Same-store sales climbed 11% during the period, driven in part by D&B Sports lounges. Food and beverage sales jumped 18% to $103 million, while revenue from the company's amusements and other segment grew 24%.

Shares in the company, which have gained 75% since the company's IPO through Tuesday's close, added 1.2% to $31 in after-hours trading.
