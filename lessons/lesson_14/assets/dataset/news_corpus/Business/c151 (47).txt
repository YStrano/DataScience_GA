GuocoLand's Q3 profit surges 130% to $49.5m

PROPERTY firm GuocoLand reported a 130 per cent surge in third-quarter net profit to $49.5 million yesterday.

Revenue rose 21 per cent to $325.9 million in the three months to March 31 from a year earlier.

The firm said this was due to revenue recognised after selling serviced apartments with a gross floor area of 31,067 sq m in the Shanghai Guoson Centre.

Administrative expenses - a major cost item - increased from $19.4 million to $26.7 million in the third quarter, mainly owing to higher sales and marketing expenses that were incurred in Singapore.

Finance costs fell 22 per cent, mostly owing to higher capitalisation of interest expenses and repayment of some loans during the period.

GuocoLand added that inventories increased by 20 per cent owing to the addition of a residential site in Sims Drive.

Trade and other assets fell by $180.8 million to $291.5 million for the quarter, "because the tender deposit placed for Sims Drive was reclassified to inventories during the period".

Trade and other debt increased by $166.3 million owing to the higher construction cost for Singapore projects and deposits for the Shanghai Guoson Centre's inventories.

GuocoLand noted: "In Singapore, buying sentiment for private residential property is likely to remain subdued.

"Statistics released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed that developers had sold 7,316 units for the whole of 2014, half of the 14,948 units sold in 2013."

Earnings per share for the quarter rose to 4.24 cents from 1.72 cents previously, while net asset value per share was $2.63 as of March 31, up from $2.36 as of June 30.

GuocoLand shares yesterday rose 2.5 cents to $1.845.
