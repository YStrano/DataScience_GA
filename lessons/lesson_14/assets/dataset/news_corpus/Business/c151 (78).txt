Rite Aid Earnings Buoyed by Big Tax Benefit; Earnings surged in latest quarter thanks to $1.72 billion tax credit

Rite Aid Corp. said its earnings surged in the latest quarter thanks to a $1.72 billion tax credit, but the pharmacy chain offered muted guidance for the recently started business year.

Rite Aid is the nation's No. 3 drugstore chain by sales behind Walgreen Co. and CVS Caremark Corp. and operates 4,750 stores nationwide. Like other drugstore chains, Rite Aid has adjusted its offerings in an effort to broaden its business model as the pharmacy and drugstore industry expands into the health and wellness sector.

For the year ending in February 2016, the company forecast a per-share profit of 19 cents to 27 cents and sales between $26.9 billion and $27.4 billion, same-store sales up 2.5% to 4.5%.

Analysts had expected a per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $27.19 billion.

Meanwhile, the company posted a profit for the quarter ended Feb. 28 of $1.84 billion, or $1.79 a share, up from $55.4 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose to $6.85 billion from $6.6 billion.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected revenue of $6.8 billion and earnings of seven cents for the quarter.

Rite Aid reported last month that sales at stores open at least a year improved 4.5%, including growth of 2% in the front of the store and an increase of 5.7% in the pharmacy business. The number of prescriptions filled grew 3.5%. Prescription sales accounted for 68% of total drugstore sales, though it has been pressured by competition from new generic drugs.
