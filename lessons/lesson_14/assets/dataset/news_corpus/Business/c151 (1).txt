Intel Earnings May Send Stock Higher

Intel's (ticker: INTC) options trading pattern suggests some investors think the stock's 13% year-to-date decline masks an earnings rally.

Over the past 10 sessions, investors have bought about 61,000 April $34 calls, which expire on April 17, and about 35,000 April $33.50 calls, which expire April 24. The stock is around $31, and associated options are priced as if next week's earnings news will cause the stock to make an extraordinarily sharp move.

With earnings expected April 14, Intel's implied volatility is 29%, near a 52-week high. Goldman Sachs is telling clients Intel's options indicate the stock will move 7% on earnings news. To put that number in context, consider that over the past eight quarters, Intel's stock has moved 2% on average, up or down, in reaction to earnings news.

Intel slashed its earnings guidance last month, citing weak PC sales, lower computer supply chain inventory, and currency headwinds. Analysts reduced first-quarter revenue guidance to $12.8 billion, $900 million shy of initial $13.7 billion.

Intel is expected to report earnings of 41 cents per share, down from an estimated 51 cents just 90 days ago.

Despite Intel's elevated volatility, Intel's upside calls that capture earnings are not bank breakers. The April $31.50 call traded at 78 cents with the stock at $31.47. The April $32 call recently traded at 57 cents. Both have implied volatility of about 41%.

Meanwhile, Intel's April $29.50 put is priced at 19 cents, and the April $30 put is priced at 28 cents.

Though most investors sell options when volatility is high, and buy them when low, a different approach seems merited for Intel. Investor expectations seem so dour into earnings that any bit of good news could cause a powerful rally.

Aggressive investors can consider a risk reversal on Intel. Buy the April $32 call for 57 cents, and sell the April $30 put for 28 cents.

This trade expresses a view that Intel rises above $32 on earnings. At $33, the call is worth $1. The money received from selling the put, meanwhile, is kept if the stock is above $30 at expiration. If the stock declines below $30, investors are obligated to buy the stock or cover the put at a higher price.

Using a risk reversal to position for an advance reflects the long-term message in Intel's overall options market pattern. Intel's most-widely owned options are the January $40 call, the January $35 call and the April $34 call. This suggests expectation the stock incrementally advances as the year matures. The April earnings trade fast-forwards the year.

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the expiration date of Intel's $34 calls.
