Railcar Maker Greenbrier Boosts Guidance Again; Fiscal second-quarter earnings more than tripled as the company benefited from greater scale

Greenbrier Cos. Inc. on Tuesday boosted its outlook again for its fiscal year ending in August after a surge in deliveries helped drive better-than-expected results in the railcar maker's February quarter.

Shares gained 5% in premarket trading.

For the fiscal year, Greenbrier now expects to post per-share earnings of $5.65 to $5.95, up from the raised outlook of $5.20 to $5.50 in earnings it gave in January. The Lake Oswego, Ore., company expects revenue of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion for the year, compared with its January forecast for $2.6 billion in revenue.

Greenbrier added that it expects its deal to buy a 20% stake in South American railcar maker Amsted-Maxion Hortolândia to close in its current quarter.

The deal is expected to help Greenbrier capitalize on growing demand in Brazil as an aging railway network is expanded and modernized.

For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Greenbrier said its earnings more than tripled from a year ago as the company benefited from greater scale and efforts to boost efficiency. Gross margin widened to 19.9% from 11.5% a year earlier.

New railcar deliveries jumped 30% from the November quarter to 5,200 units, while backlog was up 11.7% to 46,000 units, carrying an estimated value of $4.78 billion.

Greenbrier said some of its orders span multiple years and cover various car types, an indication that demand for new railcars will remain strong for the foreseeable future.

Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, Greenbrier posted a profit of $50.4 million, or $1.57 a share, up from $15.6 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier.

Revenue surged 25.5% to $630.2 million.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of $1.20 a share on revenue of $613.9 million.
