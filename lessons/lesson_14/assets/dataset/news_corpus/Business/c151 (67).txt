International Speedway Revenue Rises on Higher Attendance; Revenue from admissions increases to $30.5 million

International Speedway Corp. said sales rose 3.6% in the February quarter, buoyed by higher attendance at its key Daytona 500 event and increased food revenue.

Results beat Wall Street expectations.

The company has been pressured in recent quarters as it struggled to lure cost-conscious racing fans to the tracks, but it has seen improvement as the economy recovers.

International Speedway operates 13 of the nation's major motor sports entertainment facilities, including the Daytona International Speedway in Florida, home of the Daytona 500. The company also owns and operates Motor Racing Network, an independent sports radio network, and promotes more than 100 racing events annually.

For the period ended Feb. 28, the company posted a profit of $15 million, or 32 cents a share, down from $19.9 million, or 43 cents a share a year earlier.

Excluding marketing and consulting costs associated with the renovation of Daytona, among other items, the company said its profit was 36 cents a share, up from 33 cents a share in the prior-year period.

Total revenue rose 3.6% to $136.6 million.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected per-share earnings of 29 cents, on revenue of $128 million.

The quarter's earnings included additional income from nonrecurring transactions related to an agreement with Fanatics Retail Group.

Revenue from food, beverages and merchandise grew 12% to $14.7 million, while revenue from admissions increased 1.6% to $30.5 million.

Motorsports-related revenue—its biggest top line contributor—grew 2.6% to $87.4 million.

The company affirmed its full-year guidance.

Shares, inactive premarket, have been up about 7% this year through Monday's close.
