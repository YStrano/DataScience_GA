WD-40 Posts Stronger-Than-Expected Results but Trims Outlook; Sales in the Asia-Pacific region jumped 28% on strong sales of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product

WD-40 Co. reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for its latest quarter but trimmed its outlook for the year, blaming foreign exchange rates.

The San Diego company, which makes cleaning and maintenance products including its namesake lubricant, said sales were driven by its Asia-Pacific segment. Sales in the region jumped 28% as a result of strong sales of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product, continued growth of the WD-40 Specialist product line and expanded distribution in China.

In the Americas, though, sales fell 1.1%. The company said the decline was in part attributable to the timing of promotional activities. The Americas segment represents 46% of overall revenue.

Sales in WD-40's Europe, Middle East, Africa and India segment rose 1.5%. The company said the political crisis in Ukraine and Russia offset strong sales of its WD-40 Multi-Use Product in Northern Europe and the Middle East.

For the year ending in August, the company now projects a profit of $3.07 to $3.13 a share on $387 million to $400 million in revenue. Previously, WD-40 expected $3.07 to $3.16 in per-share profit and $398 million to $413 million in revenue.

“Our underlying business is performing in line with our previously issued guidance," said Chief Financial Officer Jay Rembolt. “However, in view of current foreign currency exchange conditions, we have updated our previously issued guidance."

For the quarter ended Feb. 28, the company reported a profit of $11.3 million, or 76 cents a share, up from $10.3 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.

Total sales rose 3.3% to $97.3 million.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for 72 cents in per-share profit on $97 million in revenue.

Shares, which are up about 12% over the past 12 months through Wednesday's close, were little changed in after-hours trading.
