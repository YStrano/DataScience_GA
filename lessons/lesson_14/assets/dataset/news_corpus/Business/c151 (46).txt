Ezra suffers steep drop in Q2 earnings

OFFSHORE contractor Ezra Holdings saw a heavy drop in its second-quarter earnings, even as revenue held steady.

The mainboard-listed group posted a net profit of US$138,000 (S$187,400) for the three months to Feb 28, way down from the US$19.6 million previously.

Revenue inched up 1 per cent to US$301.9 million, mostly via contributions from non-controlling interests.

For the half year, net profit jumped 110 per cent to US$54.6 million, while revenue slid 3 per cent to about US$623 million.

The revenue slide was caused by lower contributions from its subsea services division as well as its offshore support and production services division.

This translates to earnings per share of 5.38 US cents for the six months to Feb 28, more than double the 2.56 US cents in the same period a year ago. Net asset value per share stood at 133.48 US cents as at Feb 28, up from the 117 US cents as at Aug 31 last year.

Ezra group chief executive Lionel Lee acknowledged in a statement yesterday that the oil and gas industry "continues to face ongoing headwinds".

But he added that the group is seeing results from its strategy to streamline core operations and focus on cash-flow generation, which is "well under way".

"While the current environment is challenging and will cause volatility in our results, we are cautiously optimistic that the long-term fundamentals of the oil and gas industry will remain encouraging."

The group's backlog stands at about US$2.3 billion, the bulk of which is expected to be executed over the next two years.

Ezra shares closed half a cent higher at 44 cents yesterday.
