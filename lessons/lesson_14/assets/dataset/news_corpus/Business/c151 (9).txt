Habit Restaurants Sees 1Q Sales Growth, Announces Stock Sale

Habit Restaurants Inc., the burger chain that went public in November, expects to report first-quarter comparable restaurant sales growth of 12.4% to 12.6%.

The company also said stockholders, including Greenwich, Conn., firm KarpReilly, plan to sell at least 5 million Habit shares. An investor group led by KarpReilly bought a majority stake in Habit in 2007.

Habit's IPO priced above expectations at $18 and shares more than doubled on their first trading day. In after-hours trading Tuesday, the stock was down 1.3% to $29.95.

Habit projects revenue of $54.3 million to $54.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, compared with the year-earlier figure of $37.8 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projected $50 million.

Last month, the Irvine, Calif.-based company said fourth-quarter sales rose sharply, while net income declined slightly amid higher expenses. After reporting a comparable-restaurant sales increase of 13.2% for the fourth quarter, Habit projected growth of 2.5% to 3% for the 2015 year.

Habit has more than 100 restaurants. Its first location opened in Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1969, and it made its East Coast debut last year with a Fair Lawn, N.J., site. In January, Habit announced a franchise agreement with Food Quest Restaurant Management to develop up to 50 restaurants in six Middle East countries, marking Habit's first overseas agreement.

The company is part of a wave of newer chains like Smashburger and Five Guys that have threatened fast-food icons like McDonald's Corp. Shake Shack Inc. had a successful IPO in January and is rapidly expanding.
