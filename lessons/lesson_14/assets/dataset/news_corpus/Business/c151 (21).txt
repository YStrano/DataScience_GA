Car makers report best monthly sales in 16 years

News | AUTOMOTIVE

More cars were registered in March than in any other month for 16 years as companies felt confident enough about the economy to increase their vehicle fleets.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said 492,774 cars were registered - the best result since the twice-yearly number-plate changes were introduced in 1999. It was the 37th consecutive month of growth for the UK's new-car market.

Experts put the boost down to new models and financial packages, along with low interest rates, but it was companies buying up fleets that was particularly helpful - sales rose 11.6 per cent year on year in the sector. Registrations so far this year have increased by 6.8 per cent to 734,588.

Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: "The best month this century for new car registrations is a welcome boost for the UK's thriving automotive sector. The challenge for a new government and industry will be to maintain this momentum and to strengthen Britain's manufacturing capabilities through continued investment, innovation and policies, which maintain our global competitiveness."

Car production across the UK is expected to exceed prerecession levels this year, helped by a strong export market that delivered revenues of £26.2bn in 2014, with 257,300 cars rolling off the production lines.

Ford remains Britain's biggestselling marque, with 63,470 new cars registered in March, followed by Vauxhall with 48,689 and Volkswagen selling 38,685 cars.

In the luxury market, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz sold 29,153, 26,925 and 26,616 cars, respectively, while at the top end 250 Bentleys were registered and 212 Aston Martins and 202 Maseratis drove off the forecourts.

BMW said both its Mini and BMW brands achieved record UK sales last month, as did Ford.

However, Mr Hawes warned that with the general election coming up, politicians must fight for Britain to stay in the EU to protect the automotive industry's future success.

He added: "Whatever the general election result, the new government must keep up the commitment to the sector which is delivering at home and abroad."

The SMMT said growth in domestic manufacturing had brought more than £14bn of investment to the UK since 2011, creating 30,000 jobs.
